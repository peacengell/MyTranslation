### Desktop Upgrade ###

After a few seconds, you will see a screen like below that saying: “**However, Ubuntu 14.10 is available now (you have 14.04)**”. Click on the button Upgrade to start upgrading to Ubuntu 14.10.

That’s it.. Start using the new Ubuntu version.

### Server Upgrade ###

To upgrade from Ubuntu 14.04 server to Ubuntu 14.10 server, do the following steps.

Install the update-manager-core package if it is not already installed:

    sudo apt-get install update-manager-core

Edit the file /etc/update-manager/release-upgrades,

    sudo nano /etc/update-manager/release-upgrades

and set Prompt=normal or Prompt=lts as shown below.

    # Default behavior for the release upgrader.
    
    [DEFAULT]
    # Default prompting behavior, valid options:
    #
    #  never  - Never check for a new release.
    #  normal - Check to see if a new release is available.  If more than one new
    #           release is found, the release upgrader will attempt to upgrade to
    #           the release that immediately succeeds the currently-running
    #           release.
    #  lts    - Check to see if a new LTS release is available.  The upgrader
    #           will attempt to upgrade to the first LTS release available after
    #           the currently-running one.  Note that this option should not be
    #           used if the currently-running release is not itself an LTS
    #           release, since in that case the upgrader won't be able to
    #           determine if a newer release is available.
    Prompt=normal

Now, it is time to upgrade your server system to latest version using the following command:

    sudo do-release-upgrade -d

Follow the on-screen instructions. You’re done!!.

Cheers!!
